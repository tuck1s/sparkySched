# sparkySched   
Simple command-line tool to make scheduled transmissions through SparkPost using a stored template, with
- recipient list
- template ID
- sending time

specified through parameters.

## Pre-requisites
Install the [python-sparkpost](https://github.com/sparkpost/python-sparkpost) library using
```
pip install sparkpost
```

Set up a sparkpost.ini file as follows.
  
```
[SparkPost]
# SparkPost Enterprise EU values
Authorization = "##myAPIkey##"
Host = "demo.sparkpostelite.com"
Return-Path = "bounces@elite.trysparkpost.com"
Binding = "outbound"
BatchSize = "10000"
Campaign = "Daily send test 10k batches"
```

The surrounding quotes are needed.

Replace `##myAPIkey##` with your specific, private API key. 

The `host`, `Return-Path` and `Binding` attributes are only needed for SparkPost Enterprise service usage; you can omit them for [sparkpost.com](https://www.sparkpost.com/).

The `BatchSize` attribute can be left at 10000, the Best Practices article below discusses this.

The `Campaign` attribute is free format text and is helpful for filtering reports on the UI.

The tool injects messages using the specified local recipients file and existing SparkPost stored template (referred to by template_ID),  with a scheduled start time.

An example recipients file that is destined for the [Smart Sink](https://support.sparkpost.com/customer/portal/articles/2560839-how-do-i-test-using-the-sink-server-on-sparkpost-) is included for test purposes.
They will show up as actual deliveries in your account (because they are actually getting delivered; and they count towards your account volume allowance).

## Usage
```
$ ./sparkySched.py

##Performance considerations
You'll get the very best performance if you are able to host the tool "close" to the SparkPost injection point i.e. low latency.

A real production injector should also make use of concurrency - see [best practices](https://support.sparkpost.com/customer/portal/articles/2249268), but please note this code is deliberately sending single-recipient-per-call.

## TODO / possible extensions
Global substitution data / metadata, and per-recipient data / metadata could be included via extensions to the command-line parameters and recipients file format.
