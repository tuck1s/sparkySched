# sparkySched   
Simple command-line tool to make scheduled transmissions through SparkPost using a stored template, with
- recipient list
- template ID
- sending time

specified through parameters.

## Pre-requisites
Install the [python-sparkpost](https://github.com/sparkpost/python-sparkpost) library using
```
pip install sparkpost
```

Set up a basic sparkpost.ini file:
```ini
[SparkPost]
Authorization = ##myAPIkey##
```

Replace `##myAPIkey##` with your specific, private API key. 

The full suite of options is as follows:
```ini
[SparkPost]
Authorization = ##myAPIkey##
Host = demo.sparkpostelite.com

#Campaign setup
Binding = outbound
Campaign = avocado-saladcopter
Return-Path = bounces@elite.trysparkpost.com
GlobalSub = {"subject": "Fresh avocado delivered to your door in 30 minutes by our flying saladcopter"}
BatchSize = 2000
```
The `Host`, `Binding` and `Return-Path` attributes are needed for SparkPost Enterprise service usage; you can omit them for [sparkpost.com](https://www.sparkpost.com/).

The `BatchSize` attribute is optional.  If omitted, a default of 10000 is used. The Best Practices article below discusses this.

The `Campaign` attribute is optional, free format text and is helpful for filtering reports on the UI.

The `GlobalSub` attribute is optional, JSON-formatted text, enabling you to set [template substitution values](https://developers.sparkpost.com/api/substitutions-reference.html).

The tool injects messages using the specified local recipients file and existing SparkPost stored template (referred to by template_ID),  with a scheduled start time.

An example recipients file that is destined for the [Smart Sink](https://support.sparkpost.com/customer/portal/articles/2560839-how-do-i-test-using-the-sink-server-on-sparkpost-) is included for test purposes.
They will show up as actual deliveries in your account (because they are actually getting delivered; and they count towards your account volume allowance).

The recipients file input format can be either
- a simple list of email addresses, one per line, or
- a .csv file, formatted as per SparkPost's own recipient-list format (template available from the app.sparkpost.com UI), containing `email,name,return_path,metadata,substitution_data,tags`

## Usage
```
$ ./sparkySched.py

## Performance considerations
You'll get the very best performance if you are able to host the tool "close" to the SparkPost injection point i.e. low latency.

A real production injector can also make use of concurrency (not done here) - see [best practices](https://support.sparkpost.com/customer/portal/articles/2249268).
